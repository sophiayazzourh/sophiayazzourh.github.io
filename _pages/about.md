I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Biostatistics at McGill University, working under the supervision of [Erica Moodie](https://www.ericamoodie.com/) and in collaboration with [Susan Shortreed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/susan-m-shortreed-1267a710/) (Kaiser Permanente). My research focuses on statistical methods for precision medicine, including the development of dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs), causal inference, and applications to patients with depression.

I hold a Ph.D. from the *Institut de Mathématiques de Toulouse* (IMT), where I developed reinforcement learning approaches for optimizing treatment sequences in healthcare settings. I also hold an engineering degree from the *Institut National des Sciences Appliquées* (INSA) of Toulouse, with a specialization in applied mathematics and statistics.



**Research interests**: Reinforcement Learning, Precision Medicine, Dynamic Treatment Regimes, Individualized Treatment Regime, Bayesian Support Vector Machine, Preference Learning.
