My name is Sophia Yazzourh. I recently graduated with a PhD from the [*Institute of Mathematics of Toulouse*](https://www.math.univ-toulouse.fr/en/) (IMT), where I worked on reinforcement learning applied to treatment sequences for patients with chronic diseases. I also hold an engineering degree from the [*Institut National des Sciences Appliquées*](https://www.insa-toulouse.fr/en) (INSA) of Toulouse in applied mathematics.
